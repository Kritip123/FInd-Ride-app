# Find Ride App/Web App

## A Platform Revolutionizing Rural Travel
**Find Ride** is an innovative platform designed to connect passengers with local drivers in rural and semi-urban areas. Unlike popular urban ride-hailing apps, it empowers communities where services like Ola and Uber are unavailable. With features like bargaining, low commission rates, and easy access, the app is a game-changer for both passengers and drivers.

## Features

### Working:
1. **Dual Platform:** Available as both a mobile app and a web app for broader accessibility.
2. **Two Main Options:**
   - **Check:** Displays a list of nearby autos, rickshaws, taxis, and more within a 3 km radius.
   - **Drivers:** Opens a page with options for:
     - **New Registrations:** Allows drivers to register with their details.
     - **Existing Members:** Enables drivers to update their current location.
3. **Location Tracking:** Uses GPS and the Great Circle Distance formula to find and display nearby drivers along with their details (name, phone number, etc.).
4. **Direct Communication:** Users can directly call drivers, replicating the simplicity of offline interactions.
5. **Fair Listing:** Implements the **Longest Job First (LJF)** algorithm to ensure fair ride allocation among drivers.
6. **Offline-Friendly:** Drivers without smartphones can register their permanent location for ride notifications.

### Facilities:
#### USER’s Perspective:
1. Targets areas where online cab booking is unavailable (e.g., villages, smaller towns).
2. Offers passengers the ability to negotiate fares, unlike fixed pricing models of existing platforms.
3. Operates on lower bandwidth and doesn’t require app installation, making it accessible even in areas with limited connectivity.

#### Driver’s Perspective:
1. Supports a variety of vehicles (e.g., autos, rickshaws, taxis, Toto) and empowers drivers to double their income.
2. Eliminates middlemen; drivers retain 100% of their earnings.
3. Circumvents restrictions from auto unions by enabling direct passenger-driver connections.

---

## Business Plan:
1. Seamless online registration process (no KYC required).
2. Offline training workshops to educate auto union representatives about the platform.
3. Promoted through village events, functions, and mass gatherings to increase awareness.
4. Dedicated helpline for resolving queries and providing assistance.
5. Minimal operational costs with a focus on rural promotion for maximum adoption.

## Technologies Used:
- **Android Studio:** For app development.
- **Google Firebase:** For user and driver data storage.
- **Algorithms:** Great Circle Distance formula for geolocation and LJF for equitable ride distribution.
- **Open Source:** A community-driven project to make transportation accessible and fair.

## Why Find Ride Stands Out:
1. **Localized Focus:** Solves the transportation gap in rural and semi-urban areas.
2. **Empowers Communities:** Benefits both passengers and drivers through a transparent and efficient system.
3. **Scalable Design:** Built to expand and adapt to various regions with minimal resources.
